# Insider Threat Incident Runbook

## Overview
Insider threats are security risks posed by individuals within an organization, such as employees, contractors, or business partners, who intentionally or unintentionally misuse their access to sensitive systems or data. This runbook provides a structured response to insider threat incidents, covering detection, analysis, containment, and recovery phases. Each phase includes detailed steps to effectively respond to potential insider threats.

## 1. Detection Phase

### Description
The detection phase involves identifying unusual activities or behaviors that indicate a potential insider threat. User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) tools are used to detect anomalies in user actions.

### Steps to Detect
1. **User Activity Monitoring**: Use UEBA tools to monitor user activity and establish a baseline of normal behavior for each user.
2. **Behavior Anomaly Detection**: Detect deviations from normal behavior, such as unusual login times, abnormal data access patterns, or unauthorized file downloads.
3. **Alert Generation**: Configure UEBA tools to generate alerts for activities that deviate significantly from established baselines, such as accessing confidential files during non-working hours.

### Scripts
- **`ueba_anomaly_detector.py`**: Python script to identify unusual user activities based on UEBA data.

## 2. Analysis Phase

### Description
The analysis phase focuses on investigating the logs and correlating abnormal user behavior with potential security threats to determine if an insider threat is present.

### Steps to Analyze
1. **Log Correlation**: Analyze logs from various systems (e.g., authentication, file access, network traffic) to correlate abnormal user activities with potential threats.
2. **Identify Risk Indicators**: Identify indicators of potential insider threats, such as data exfiltration attempts, use of unauthorized tools, or access to restricted areas.
3. **Interview Involved Personnel**: If necessary, conduct interviews with the individuals involved to better understand the context of the abnormal activity.

### Scripts
- **`log_correlation_analyzer.py`**: Script to correlate log data to identify suspicious behavior.

## 3. Containment Phase

### Description
The containment phase aims to prevent further damage by restricting access to systems or data for individuals identified as potential insider threats.

### Steps to Contain
1. **Revoke Access**: Immediately revoke access for users exhibiting suspicious behavior to prevent further unauthorized actions.
2. **Change Permissions**: Review and modify permissions for the user to ensure that access is restricted to only what is necessary for their role.
3. **Notify Management**: Notify the appropriate management or security team members about the containment actions taken.

### Scripts
- **`revoke_user_access.ps1`**: PowerShell script to automate the process of revoking user access.
- **`modify_user_permissions.py`**: Python script to modify user permissions.

## 4. Recovery Phase

### Description
The recovery phase focuses on reinstating user access in a safe manner and reviewing security policies to prevent similar incidents in the future.

### Steps to Recover
1. **Reinstate User Access**: Re-enable access for users after determining that they no longer pose a threat, ensuring that appropriate restrictions are in place.
2. **Policy Review and Update**: Review and update security policies and procedures to address any gaps that were identified during the incident.
3. **User Training**: Provide training to the involved personnel to help them understand appropriate behavior and prevent unintentional insider threats in the future.

### Scripts
- **`reinstate_user_access.ps1`**: PowerShell script to reinstate user access with revised permissions.
- **`policy_review_report.py`**: Script to generate a report for policy review and recommendations.

## Flowchart
- Refer to the flowchart in the **/flowcharts/** directory for a visual representation of the insider threat response process, including detection, analysis, containment, and recovery workflows.

## Post-Incident Activities
- **Post-Mortem Analysis**: Conduct a detailed post-mortem analysis to understand the root cause of the insider threat and identify opportunities for improvement.
- **Update Runbook**: Update this runbook based on lessons learned to improve the response to insider threats.
- **Management Review**: Present the findings to management, including the risks posed by insider threats and the steps taken to mitigate them.

## Tools & References
- **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)**: Tools like Splunk User Behavior Analytics or Microsoft Defender for Identity to detect anomalies in user behavior.
- **Log Analysis Tools**: Tools like ELK Stack or Splunk to analyze and correlate log data from various systems.

## Summary
This runbook provides a structured approach to handling insider threat incidents, ensuring effective detection, analysis, containment, and recovery. By following these steps, SOC analysts can mitigate the impact of insider threats and enhance the organization's resilience against such incidents.
